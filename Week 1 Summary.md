# Introduction-to-Computer-Science

Mario was way too hard in comparison to the stuff that was discussed in the lectures and also in comparison with water and greedy. FIrst solution that printed right was not accepted for Mario had to do a longer one that took me ages to figure out. Finally finished Week 1 as of 11/07/16. Took me about a week XD
